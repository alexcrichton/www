      <h1>Final Address in Support of the League of Nations</h1>

<p>
  Mr. Chairman and fellow countrymen: It is with a great deal of genuine pleasure that I find myself in Pueblo, and I
  feel it a compliment in this beautiful hall. One of the advantages of this hall, as I look about, is that you are not
  too far away from me, because there is nothing so reassuring to men who are trying to express the public sentiment as
  getting into real personal contact with their fellow citizens. I have gained a renewed impression as I have crossed
  the continent this time of the homogeneity of this great people to whom we belong. They come from many stocks, but
  they are all of one kind. They come from many origins, but they are all shot through with the same principles and
  desire the same righteous and honest things. I have received a more inspiring impression this time of the public
  opinion of the United States than it was ever my privilege to receive before.
</p>

<p>
  The chief pleasure of my trip has been that it has nothing to do with my personal fortunes, that it has nothing to do
  with my personal reputation, that it has nothing to do with anything except great principles uttered by Americans of
  all sorts and of all parties which we are now trying to realize at this crisis of the affairs of the world. But there
  have been unpleasant impressions as well as pleasant impressions, my fellow citizens, as I have crossed the continent.
  I have perceived more and more that men have been busy creating an absolutely false impression of what the treaty of
  peace and the Covenant of the League of Nations contain and mean. I find, moreover, that there is an organized
  propaganda against the League of Nations and against the treaty proceeding from exactly the same sources that the
  organized propaganda proceeded from which threatened this country here and there with disloyalty, and I want to say --
  I cannot say too often -- any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into
  the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.
</p>

<p>
  If I can catch any man with a hyphen in this great contest I will know that I have got an enemy of the Republic. My
  fellow citizens, it is only certain bodies of foreign sympathies, certain bodies of sympathy with foreign nations that
  are organized against this great document which the American representatives have brought back from Paris. Therefore,
  in order to clear away the mists, in order to remove the impressions, in order to check the falsehoods that have
  clustered around this great subject, I want to tell you a few very simple things about the treaty and the
  covenant.
</p>

<p>
  Do not think of this treaty of peace as merely a settlement with Germany. It is that. It is a very severe settlement
  with Germany, but there is not anything in it that she did not earn. Indeed, she earned more than she can ever be able
  to pay for, and the punishment exacted of her is not a punishment greater than she can bear, and it is absolutely
  necessary in order that no other nation may ever plot such a thing against humanity and civilization. But the treaty
  is so much more than that. It is not merely a settlement with Germany; it is a readjustment of those great injustices
  which underlie the whole structure of European and Asiatic society. This is only the first of several treaties. They
  are all constructed upon the same plan. The Austrian treaty follows the same lines. The treaty with Hungary follows
  the same lines. The treaty with Bulgaria follows the same lines. The treaty with Turkey, when it is formulated, will
  follow the same lines.
</p>

<p>
  What are those lines? They are based upon the purpose to see that every government dealt with in this great
  settlement is put in the hands of the people and taken out of the hands of coteries and of sovereigns, who had no
  right to rule over the people. It is a people’s treaty, that accomplishes by a great sweep of practical justice the
  liberation of men who never could have liberated themselves, and the power of the most powerful nations ahs been
  devoted not to their aggrandizement but to the liberation of people whom they could have put under their control if
  they had chosen to do so. Not one foot of territory is demanded by submission to their authority is demanded by them.
  The men who sat around the table in Paris knew that the time had come when the people were no longer going to consent
  to live under masters, but were going to live the lives that they chose themselves, to live under such governments as
  they chose themselves to erect. That is the fundamental principle of this great settlement.
</p>

<p>
  And we did not stop with that. We added a great international charter for the rights of labor. Reject this treaty,
  impair it, and this is the consequence of the laboring men of the world, that there is no international tribunal which
  can bring the moral judgments of the world to bear upon the great labor questions of the day. What we need to do with
  regard to the labor questions of the day, my fellow countrymen, is to lift them into the light, is to lift them out of
  the haze and distraction of passion, of hostility, out into the calm spaces where men look at things without
  passion.
</p>

<p>
  The more men you get into a great discussion the more you exclude passion. Just as soon as the calm judgment of the
  worlds is directed upon the question of justice to labor, labor is going to have to forum such as it never was
  supplied with before, and men everywhere are going to see that the problem of labor is nothing more not less than the
  problem of the elevation of humanity. We must see that all the questions which have disturbed the world, all the
  questions which have disturbed the processes of industry, shall be brought out where men of all points of view, Men of
  all attitudes of mind, men of all kinds of experience, may contribute their part of the settlement of the great
  questions which we must settle and cannot ignore.
</p>

<p>
  At the front of this great treaty is put the Covenant of the League of Nations. It will also be at the front of the
  Austrian treaty and the Hungarian treaty and the Bulgarian treaty and the treaty with Turkey. Every one of them will
  contain the Covenant of the League of Nations, because you cannot work any of them without the Covenant of the League
  of Nations. Unless you get the united, concerted purpose and power of the great Governments of the world behind this
  settlement, it will fall down like a house of cards. There is only one power to put behinds the liberation of mankind,
  and that is the power of mankind. It is the power of the united moral forces of the world, and in the Covenant of the
  League of Nations the moral forces of the world are mobilized.
</p>

<p>
  For what purpose? Reflect, my fellow citizens, that the membership of this great League is going to include all the
  great fighting nations of the world, as well as the weak ones. It is not for the present going to include Germany, but
  for the time being Germany is not a great fighting country. All the nations that have power that can be mobilized are
  going to be members of this League, including the United States.
</p>

<p>
  And what do they unite for? They enter into a solemn promise to one another they will never use their power against
  one another for aggression; that they never will impair the territorial integrity of a neighbor; that they never will
  interfere with the political independence of a neighbor; that they will abide by the principle that great populations
  are entitled to determine their own destiny and that they will not interfere with that destiny; and that no matter
  what differences arise amongst them they will never resort to war without first having done one or other of two things
  -- either submitted the matter of controversy to arbitration, in which case they agree to abide by the result without
  question, or submitted it to the consideration of the council of the League of Nations, laying before that council all
  the documents, all the facts, agreeing that the council can publish the documents, all the facts, agreeing that the
  council can publish the documents and the facts to the whole world, agreeing that there shall be six months allowed
  for the mature consideration of those facts by the council, and agreeing that at the expiration of the six months,
  even if they are not then ready to accept the advice of the council with regard to the settlement of the dispute, they
  will still not go to war for another three months.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, they consent, no matter what happens, to submit every matter of difference between them to the
  judgment of mankind, and just so certainly as they do that, my fellow citizens, war will be in the far background, war
  will be pushed out of that foreground of terror in which it has kept the world for generation after generation, and
  men will know that there will be a calm time of deliberate counsel. The most dangerous thing for a bad cause is to
  expose it to the opinion of the world. The most certain way that you can prove that a man is mistaken is by letting
  all his neighbors know what he thinks, by letting all his neighbors know what he thinks, by letting all his neighbors
  discuss what he thinks, and if he is in the wrong you will notice that he will stay at home, he will not walk on the
  street. He will be afraid of the eyes of his neighbors. He will be afraid of their judgment of his character. He will
  know that his cause is lost unless he can sustain it by the arguments of right and of justice. The same law that
  applies to individuals applies to nations.
</p>

<p>
  But, you say, “We have heard that we might be at a disadvantage in the League of Nations.” Well, whoever told you
  that either was deliberately falsifying or he had not read the Covenant of the League of Nations. I leave him the
  choice. I want to give you a very simple account of the organization of the League of Nations and let you judge for
  yourselves. It is a very simple organization. The power of the League, or rather the activities of the league, lie in
  two bodies. There is the council, which consists of one representative from each of the principal allied and
  associated powers -- that is to say, the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, along with four other
  representatives of smaller powers chosen out of the general body of the membership of the League.
</p>

<p>
  The council is the source of very active policy of the League, and no active policy of the League can be adopted
  without a unanimous vote of the council. That is explicitly stated in the Covenant itself. Does it not evidently
  follow that the League of Nations can adopt no policy whatever without the consent of the United States? The
  affirmative vote of the representative of the United States is necessary in every case. Now, you have heard of six
  votes belonging to the British Empire. Those six votes are not in the council. They are in the assembly, and the
  interesting thing is that the assembly does not vote. I must qualify that statement a little, but essentially it is
  absolutely true. In every matter in which the assembly is given a voice, and there are only four or five, its vote
  does not count unless concurred in by the representatives of all the nations represented on the council, so the at
  there is no validity to any vote of the assembly unless in that vote also the representative of the United States
  concurs. That one vote of the United States is as big as the six votes of the British Empire. I am not jealous for
  advantage, my fellow citizens, but I think that is a perfectly safe situation. There is no validity in a vote, either
  by the council or the assembly, in which we do not concur. So much for the statements about the six votes for the
  British Empire.
</p>

<p>
  Look at it in another aspect. The assembly is the talking body. The assembly was created in order that anybody that
  purposed anything wrong should be subjected to the awkward circumstance that everybody could talk about it. This is
  the great assembly in which all the things that are likely to disturb the peace of the world or the good understanding
  between nations are to be exposed to the general view, and I want to ask you if you think it was unjust, unjust to the
  United States, that speaking parts should be assigned to the several portions of the British Empire? Do you think it
  unjust that there should be some spokesman in debate for that fine little stout Republic down in the Pacific, New
  Zealand? Do you think it was unjust that Australia should be allowed to stand up and take part in the debate --
  Australia, from which we have learned some of the most useful progressive policies of modern time, a little nation
  only five million in a great continent, but counting for several times five in its activities and in its interest in
  liberal reform? Do you think it unjust that that little Republic down in South Africa, whose gallant resistance to
  being subjected to any outside authority at all we admired for so many months and whose fortunes we followed with such
  interest, should have a speaking part? Great Britain obliged South Africa to submit to her sovereignty, but she
  immediately after that felt that it was convenient and right to hand the whole self-government of that colony over to
  the very men whom she had beaten.
</p>

<p>
  The representatives of South Africa in Paris were two of the most distinguished generals of the Boer Army, two of the
  realest men I ever met, two men that could talk sober counsel and wise advice, along with the best statesmen in
  Europe. To exclude Gen. Botha and Gen. Smuts from the right to stand up in the parliament of the world and say
  something concerning the affairs of mankind would be absurd. And what about Canada? Is not Canada a good neighbor? I
  ask you is not Canada more likely to agree with the United States than with Great Britain? Canada has a speaking part.
  And then, for the first time in the history of the world, that great voiceless multitude, that throng hundreds of
  millions strong in India, has a voice, and I want to testify that some of the wisest and most dignified figures in the
  peace conference at Paris came form India, men who seemed to carry in their minds an older wisdom than the rest of us
  had, whose traditions ran back into so many of the unhappy fortunes of mankind that they seemed very useful counselors
  as to how some ray of hope and some prospect of happiness could be opened to its people. I for my part have no
  jealousy whatever of those five speaking parts in the assembly. Those speaking parts cannot translate themselves into
  five votes that can in any matter override the voice and purpose of the United States.
</p>

<p>
  Let us sweep aside all this language of jealousy. Let us be big enough to know the facts and to welcome the facts,
  because the facts are based upon the principle that America has always fought for, namely, the equality of
  self-governing peoples, whether they were big or little -- not counting men, but counting rights, not counting
  representation, but counting the purpose of that representation. When you hear an opinion quoted you do no count the
  number of persons who hold it; you ask, “Who said that?” You weigh opinions, you do not count them, and the beauty of
  all democracies is that every voice can be heard, every voice can have its effect, every voice can contribute to the
  general judgment that is finally arrived at. That is the object of democracy. Let us accept what America has always
  fought for, and accept it with pride that America showed the way and made the proposal. I do not mean that America
  made the proposal in this particular instance; I mean that the principle was an American principle, proposed by
  America.
</p>

<p>
  When you come to the heart of the Covenant, my fellow citizens, you will find it in article ten, and I am very much
  interested to know that the other things have been blown away like bubbles. There is nothing in the other contentions
  with regard to the league of nations, but there is something in article ten that you ought to realize and ought to
  accept or reject. Article ten is the heart of the whole matter. What is article ten? I never am certain that I can
  from memory give a literal repetition of its language, but I am sure that I can give an exact interpretation of its
  meaning. Article ten provides that every member of the league covenants to respect and preserve the territorial
  integrity and existing political independence of every other member of the league as against external aggression. Not
  against internal disturbance. There was not a man at that table who did not admit the sacredness of the right of
  self-determination, the sacredness of the right of any body of people to say that they would not continue to live
  under the Government they were then living under, and under article eleven of the Covenant they are given a place to
  say whether they will live under it or not. For following article ten is article eleven, which makes it the right of
  any member of the League at any time to call attention to anything, anywhere, that is likely to disturb the peace of
  the world or the good understanding between nations upon which the peace of the world depends. I want to give you an
  illustration of what that would mean.
</p>

<p>
  You have heard a great deal -- something that was true and a great deal that was false--about the provision of the
  treaty which hands over to Japan the rights which Germany enjoyed in the Province of Shantung in China. In the first
  place, Germany did not enjoy any rights there that other nations had not already claimed. For my part, my judgment, my
  moral judgment, is against the whole set of concessions. They were all of them unjust to China, they ought never to
  have been exacted, they were all exacted by duress, from a great body of thoughtful and ancient and helpless people.
  There never was any right in any of them. Thank God, America never asked for any, never dreamed of asking for
  any.
</p>

<p>
  But when Germany got this concession in 1898, the Government of the United States made no protest whatever. That was
  not because the Government of the United States was not in the hands of thigh-minded and conscientious men. It was.
  William McKinley was President and John Hay was Secretary of State -- as safe hands to leave the honor of the United
  States in as any that you can cite. They made no protest because the state of international law a that time was that
  it was none of their business unless they could show that the interests of the United States were affected, and the
  only think that they could show with regard to the interests of the United States was that Germany might close the
  doors of Shantung Province against the trade of the United States.
</p>

<p>
  They, therefore, demanded and obtained promises that we could continue to sell merchandise in Shantung. Immediately
  following that concession to Germany there was a concession to Russia of the same sort, of Port Arthur, and Port
  Arthur was handed over subsequently to Japan on the very territory of the United States. Don’t you remember that when
  Russia and Japan got into war with one another the war was brought to a confusion by a treaty written at Portsmouth,
  N.H., and in that treaty without the slightest intimation from any authoritative sources in America that the
  Government of the United States had any objection, Port Arthur, Chinese territory, was turned over to Japan? I want
  you distinctly to understand that there is no thought of criticism in my mind. I am expounding to you a state of
  international law.
</p>

<p>
  Now, read articles ten and eleven. You will see that international law is revolutionized by putting morals into it.
  Article ten says that no member of the League, and that includes all these nations that have demanded these things
  unjustly of China, shall impair the territorial integrity or the political independence of any other member of the
  League. China is going to be a member of the League. Article eleven says that nay member of the League can call
  attention to anything that is likely to disturb the peace of the world or the good understanding between nations, and
  China is for the first time in the history of mankind afforded a standing before the jury of the world. I, for my
  part, have a profound sympathy for China, and I am proud to have taken part in an arrangement which promises the
  protection of the world to the rights o China. The whole atmosphere of the world is changed by a thing like that, my
  fellow citizens. The whole international practice of the world is revolutionized.
</p>

<p>
  But, you will say, “What is the second sentence of article ten? That is what gives very disturbing thoughts.” The
  second sentence is that the council of the League shall advise what steps, if any, are necessary to carry out the
  guaranty of the first sentence, namely, that the members will respect and preserve the territorial integrity and
  political independence of the other members. I do not know any other meaning for the word “advise” except “advise.”
  The council advises, and it cannot advise without the vote of the United States. Why gentlemen should fear that the
  Congress of the United States would be advised to do something that it did not want to do I frankly cannot imagine,
  because they cannot even be advised to do anything unless their own representative has participated in the advice.
</p>

<p>
  It may be that that will impair somewhat the vigor of the League, but, nevertheless, the fact is so, that we are not
  obliged to take any advice except our own, which to any man who wants to go his own course is a very satisfactory
  state of affairs. Every man regards his own advice as best, and I dare say every man mixes his own advice with some
  thought of his own interest. Whether we use it wisely or unwisely, we can use the vote of the United States to make
  impossible drawing the United States into any enterprise that she does not care to be drawn into.
</p>

<p>
  Yet article ten strikes at the taproot of war. Article ten is a statement that the very things that have always been
  sought in imperialistic wars are henceforth foregone by every ambitious nation in the world. I would have felt very
  much disturbed if, sitting at the peace table in Paris, I had supposed that I was expounding my own ideas. Whether you
  believe it or not, I know the relative size of my own ideas; I know how they stand related in bulk and proportion to
  the moral judgments of my fellow countrymen, and I proposed nothing whatever at the peace table at Paris that I had
  not sufficiently certain knowledge embodied the moral judgment of the citizens of the United States. I had gone over
  there with, so to say, explicit instruction. Don’t you remember that we laid down fourteen points which should contain
  the principles of the settlement? They were not my points. In every one of them I was conscientiously trying to read
  the thought of the people of the United States, and after I uttered those points I had every assurance given me that
  could be given me that they did speak the moral judgment of the United States and not my single judgment.
</p>

<p>
  Then when it came to that critical period just a little less than a year ago, when it was evident that the war was
  coming to its critical end, all the nations engaged in the war accepted those fourteen principles explicitly as the
  basis of the armistice and the basis of the peace. In those circumstances I crossed the ocean under bond to my own
  people and to the other governments with which I was dealing. The whole specification of the method of settlement was
  written down and accepted before hand, and we were architects building on those specifications. It reassures me and
  fortifies my position to find how before I went over men whose judgment the United States has often trusted were of
  exactly the same opinion that I went abroad to express. Here is something I want to read from Theodore Roosevelt:
</p>

<p>
  “The one effective move for obtaining peace is by an agreement among all the great powers in which each should pledge
  itself no only to abide by the decisions of a common tribunal but to back its decisions by force. The great civilized
  nations should combine by solemn agreement in a great would league for the peace of righteousness; a court should be
  established. A changed and amplified Hague court would meet the requirements, composed of representatives from each
  nation, whose representatives are sworn to act as judges in each case and not in a representative capacity.” Now there
  is article ten. He goes on and says this: “The nations should agree on certain rights that should not be questioned,
  such as territorial integrity, their right to deal with their domestic affairs, and with such matters as whom they
  should admit to citizenship. All such guarantee each of their number in possession of these rights.”
</p>

<p>
  Now, the other specification is the Covenant. The Covenant in another portion guarantees to the members the
  independent control of their domestic questions. There is not a leg of these gentlemen to stand on when they say that
  the interests of the United States are not safeguarded in the very points where we are most sensitive. You do not need
  to be told again that the Covenant expressly says that nothing in this covenant shall be construed as affecting the
  validity of the Monroe doctrine for example. You could not be more explicit than that. And every point of interest is
  covered, partly for one very interesting reason. This is not the first time that the Foreign Relations Committee of
  the Senate of the United States ahs read and considered this covenant. I bought it to this country in March last in a
  tentative, provisional form, in practically the form that it now has, with the exception of certain additions which I
  shall mention immediately. I asked the Foreign Relations Committees of both Houses to come to the White House and we
  spent a long evening in the frankest discussion of every portion that they wished to discuss. They made certain
  specific suggestions as to what should be contained in this document when it was to be revised. I carried those
  suggestions to Paris, and every one of them was adopted. What more could I have done? What more could have been
  obtained? The very matters upon which these gentlemen were most concerned were, the right of withdrawal, which is now
  expressly stated; the safeguarding of the Monroe doctrine, whish is now accomplished/; the exclusion from action by
  the League of domestic questions, which is now accomplished. All along the line, every suggestion of the United States
  was adopted after the Covenant had been drawn up in its first form and had been published of the criticism of the
  world. There is a very true sense in which I can say this is a tested American document.
</p>

<p>
  I am dwelling upon these points, my fellow citizens, in spite of the fact that I dare say to most of you they are
  perfectly well know, because in order to meet the present situation we have go to know what we are dealing with. We
  are not dealing with the kind of document which this is represented by some gentlemen to be; and inasmuch as we are
  dealing with a document simon-pure in respect of the very principles we have professed and lived up to, we have got to
  do one or other of two things -- we have go to adopt it or reject it. There is no middle course. You cannot go in on a
  special-privilege basis of your own.
</p>

<p>
  I take it that you are too proud to ask to be exempted from responsibilities which the other members of the League
  will carry. We go in upon equal terms or we do not go in at all; and if we do not go in, my fellow citizens, think of
  the tragedy of that result -- the only sufficient guaranty to the peace of the world withheld! Ourselves drawn apart
  with that dangerous pride which means that we shall be ready to take care of ourselves, and that means that we shall
  maintain great standing armies and an irresistible envy; that means we shall have the organization of a military
  nation; that means we shall have a general staff, with the kind of power that the general staff of Germany had; to
  mobilize this great manhood of the Nation when it pleases, all the energy of our young men drawn into the thought and
  preparation for war. What of our pledges to the men that lie dead in France? Wee said that they went over there not to
  prove the prowess of America or her readiness for another war but to see to tit hat there never was such a war again.
  It always seems to make it difficult for me to say anything my fellow citizens, when I think of my clients in this
  case. My clients are the children; my clients are the next generation. They do not know what promises and bonds I
  undertook when I ordered the armies of the United States to the soil of France, but I know, and I intend to redeem my
  pledges to the children; they shall not be sent upon a similar errand.
</p>

<p>
  Again and again, my fellow citizens, mothers who lost their sons in France have come to me and, taking my hand, have
  shed tears upon it not only, but they added, “God bless you, Mr. President!” Why, my fellow citizens, should they pray
  God to bless me? I advised the Congress of the United States to create the situation that led to the death of their
  sons. I ordered their sons overseas. I consented to their sons being put in the most difficult parts of the battle
  line, where death was certain, as in the impenetrable difficulties of the forest of Argonne. Why should they weep upon
  my hand and call down the blessings of God upon me? Because they believe that their boys died for something that
  vastly transcends any of the immediate and palpable objects of the war. They believe, and they rightly believe, that
  their sons saved the liberty of the world. They believe that wrapped up with the liberty of the world is the
  continuous protection of that liberty by the concerted powers of all civilized people. They believe that this
  sacrifice was made in order that other sons should not be called upon for a similar gift -- the gift of life, the gift
  of all that died -- and if we did not see this thing through, if we fulfilled the dearest present wish of Germany and
  now dissociated ourselves from those alongside whom we fought in the world, would not something of the halo go away
  from the gun over the mantelpiece, or the sword? Would not the old uniform lose something of its significance? These
  men were crusaders. They were not going forth to prove the might of the United States. They were going forth to prove
  the might of justice and right, and all the world accepted them as crusaders, and their transcendent achievement has
  made all the world believe in America as it believes in no other nation organized in the modern world. There seem to
  me to stand between us and the rejection or qualification of this treaty the serried ranks of those boys in khaki, not
  only these boys who came home, but those dear ghosts that still deploy upon the fields of France.
</p>

<p>
  My friends, on last Decoration day I went on a beautiful hillside near Paris, where was located the cemetery of
  Suresnes, a cemetery given over to the burial of the American dead. Behind me on the slopes was rank upon rank of
  living American soldiers, and lying before me upon the levels of the plain was rank upon rank of departed American
  soldiers. Right by the side of the stand where I spoke there was a little group of French women who had adopted those
  graves, had made themselves mothers of those dear ghosts by putting flowers every day upon those graves, taking them
  as their own sons, their own beloved, because they had died in the same cause -- France was free and the world was
  free because America had come! I wish some men in public life who are now opposing the settlement for which these men
  died could visit such a spot as that . I wish that the thought that comes out of those graves could penetrate their
  consciousness. I wish that they could feel the moral obligation that rests upon us not to go back on those boys, but
  to see the thing through, to see it through to the end and make good their redemption of the world. For nothing less
  depends upon this decision, nothing less than liberation and salvation of the world.

  You will say, “Is the League and absolute guaranty against war?” No; I do not know any absolute guaranty against the
  errors of human judgment or the violence of human passion, but I tell you this: With a cooling space of nine months
  for human passion, not much of it will keep hot. I had a couple of friends who were in the habit of losing their
  tempers, and when they lost their tempers they were in the habit of using very unparlimentary language. Some of their
  friends induced them to make a promise that they never would swear inside the town limits. When the impulse next came
  upon them, they took a streetcar to go out of town to swear, and by the time they got out of town they did not want to
  swear. They came back convinced that they were just what they were, a couple of unspeakable fools, and the habit of
  getting angry and of swearing suffered great inroads upon it by that experience. Now, illustrating the great by the
  small, that is true of the passion s of nations. It is true of the passions of men however you combine them. Give them
  space to cool off. I ask you this: If it is not an absolute insurance against war, do you want no insurance at all? Do
  you want nothing? Do you want not only no probability that war will not recur, but the probability that it will recur?
  The arrangements of justice of not stand of themselves, my fellow citizens. The arrangements of this treat are just,
  but they need the support of the combined power of the great nations of the world. And they will have that support.
  Now that the mists of this great question have cleared away, I believe that men will see the truth, eye to eye and
  face to face.

  There is one thing that the American people always rise to and extend their hand to, and that is the truth of justice
  and of liberty and of peace. We have accepted the truth and we are going to be led by it, and it is going to lead us,
  and through us the world, out into pastures of quietness and peace such as the world never dreamed of before.
